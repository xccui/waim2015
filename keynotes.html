				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="b">Abstract:</span></br>
				This talk presens the design of the Cipherbase system.
				Cipherbase was designed to protect "data-in-use". That is, data
				remains encrypted even when it is processed. To this end, Cipherbase
				features a novel fine-grained architecture that farms out all
				computations on encrypted data to an FPGA. The talk provides the
				motivation and design space for systems like Cipherbase and presents
				the results of recent performance experiments with the Cipherbase
				prototype developed at Microsoft Research.

				Donald Kossmann is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research
				in Redmond.  Before that, he was professor for Computer Science at ETH
				Zurich (Switzerland) where he is currently on leave.  He received his
				MS from the University of Karlsruhe and completed his PhD at the
				Technical University of Aachen. He is an ACM fellow.  He was member of
				the board of trustees of the VLDB endowment from 2006-2011 and the
				chair of the Executive Committee of ACM SIGMOD.  He is a co-founder of
				i-TV-T (1998), XQRL Inc. (acquired by BEA in 2002), 28msec Inc.
				(2006), and Teralytics (2010). His research interests lie in the area
				of databases and information systems.

				<span class="b">Title:Towards a Unified Platform for Semantically-related Data</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="b">Abstract:</span></br>
				Several research topic within data management and knowledge representation,
				deal with answering a query by making use of semantic information about the 
				data.  Examples include the semantic web, data integration, and semantic query 
				optimization.
				<br/>
				This talk will look  at the goal of a unified platform for answering queries
				that subsumes all of these problems. 
				The vision is to support distributed datasources connected
				by integrity constraints, supporting a wide variety of access models, 
				cost models, data models, constraint languages, and query languages.
				<br/>
				We will outline a bit of the history of this vision,
				and then describe one recent step towards this goal, embodied in the 
				PDQ (Proof-driven querying) system at Oxford. 
				PDQ supports a rich language for constraints and queries, along with the ability to describe several kinds of interfaces for data access. 
				<br/>
				This includes work with Balder ten Cate, Julien Leblay, Efi Tsamoura,
				and Michael Vanden Boom.

				<span class="b">Short Biography:</span></br>
				Michael Benedikt is Professor of Computer Science at Oxford University and a fellow of University College Oxford. He came to Oxford after a decade in US industrial research laboratories, including positions as Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at Bell Laboratories and visiting researcher at Yahoo! Labs. He has worked extensively in mathematical logic, finite model theory, verification, database theory, and database systems, and has served as chair of the ACM's main database theory conference, Principles of Database Systems. The current focus of his research is Web data management, with recent projects including querying of the deep Web, querying and integration of annotated data, and querying of web services.

				<span class="b">Title: Data Cleaning, Linking, and Integration: From Raw Data to Actionable Information </span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="b">Abstract:</span></br>
				Management and policy decisions are typically made based on
				information that is derived from datasets.	To prepare datasets so
				that they are ready to be analyzed requires a number of tedious and,
				oftentimes, manual data curation activities, such as data cleaning,
				linking, and integration with other datasets.
				<br/>
				In this talk, I will present some recent work on these three
				activities with particular emphasis on a recent work where we propose
				a query-oriented system for cleaning data with oracles.  Unlike prior
				data cleaning techniques where the focus has largely been to correct
				all existing data upfront, our framework is driven by the correctness
				of query results, cleans data only as needed, and also permits one to
				augment the underlying dataset through the identification of missing
				tuples in the result of a query.  Incorrect/missing tuples are
				removed/added to the result of a query through edits that are applied
				to the underlying dataset, where the edits are derived by interacting
				with domain experts which we model as oracle crowds.
				<br/>
				We show that the problem of determining minimal interactions with
				oracle crowds to derive database edits for removing/adding
				incorrect/missing tuples to the result of a query is NP-hard in
				general and present heuristic algorithms that interact with oracle
				crowds to progressively clean the dataset, as needed.  I will also
				present recent work on temporal record linkage and integration that
				allows one to identify which facts are temporally related and how they
				can be meaningfully combined together.
