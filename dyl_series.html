				<span class="b">Title: Natural Language Question Answering Over Knowledge Graph----A Data-driven Approach</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="b">Abstract:</span></br>
				As more and more RDF data become available on the web, the question of how end users can access this body of knowledge becomes of crucial importance.  Although SPARQL is a standard way to access RDF data, it remains tedious and difficult for end users because of the complexity of the SPARQL syntax and the RDF schema. An ideal system should allow end users to profit from the expressive power of Semantic Web standards (such as RDF and SPARQLs) while at the same time hiding their complexity behind an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Therefore, RDF question/ answering (Q/A) systems have received wide attention in both NLP (natural language processing) and DB (database) areas. 
				<br/>
				In this talk, besides reviewing some existing work about RDF Q/A in both NLP and DB areas, we introduce our recent work along this direction. Specifically, we design a graph-based RDF Q/A system, called gAnswer, representing an natural language question as a query graph. Then, we answer natural language questions by employing subgraph matching process. We also present another work, automatically building templates for RDF Q/A, which is based on joining natural language query workloads and SPARQL query workloads.

				Lei Zou received his BS degree and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2003 and 2009, respectively. He received a CCF (China Computer Federation) Doctoral Dissertation Nomination Award in 2009 and won Second Class Prize of CCF Natural Science Award in 2014. Since September 2009, he joined Institute of Computer Science and Technology (ICST) of Peking University (PKU) as a faculty member. He has been an associate professor in PKU since August 2012. His recent research interests include graph databases, RDF knowledge graph, particularly in graph-based RDF data management. He has published more than 30 papers, including more than 15 papers published in reputed journals and major international conferences, such as SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, TKDE, VLDB Journal.

				<span class="b">Title: Scale-independent query answering on big data</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="b">Abstract:</span></br>
				Answering queries over large datasets is often too costly. Indeed, a
				simple linear scan over big datasets may take days, even when using
				the fastest storage devices. In practice, however, one has observed that
				not all the data is needed. In many cases, only a bounded amount of
				data is used to answer queries, and better still, the required amount of
				data is independent of the total size of the data. Queries that can be
				answered in this way are called scale-independent. In this talk, an overview
				of recent work on scale-independent queries will be given, including its
				formalisation and algorithms for checking scale-independence.

				<span class="b">Short Biography:</span></br>
				Floris Geerts holds a research professor position in the Advanced Database Research and Modelling group at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. Before that, he held a senior research fellow position in the database group at the University of Edinburgh, and a postdoc position in the data mining group at the University of Helsinki. He received his Ph.D in 2001 at the University of Hasselt, Belgium. His research interests include the theory and practice of databases and the study of data quality in particular. He is the (co-)author of 75+ articles that are mainly published in the proceedings of prestigious conferences (PODS, ICDT, VLDB, ICDE) and top-tier journals (ACM TODS, JCSS, JACM, TKDE). Many of his journal papers appeared in special issues that collect the best papers from databases conferences. In addition, Floris received two best paper awards (ICDM 2001, ICDE 2007). He is currently associate editor of ACM Transactions on Database Systems and was the general chair of EDBT/ICDT 2015.

				<span class="b">Title: Social Media Mining and Analysis for Business and Financial Innovation </span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="b">Abstract:</span></br>
The recent blossom of social network services has provided
everyone with an unprecedented level of ease and fun of sharing
information of all sorts. These public social data therefore reveal a
surprisingly large amount of information about an individual which is
otherwise unavailable. The business, consumer and social insights
attainable from this big and dynamic social data are critically important
and immensely valuable in a wide range of applications for both private
and public sectors. In particular, there has been a growing interest in
harnessing social media data for business and financial innovation. In
this talk, we will explore some recent advances along this direction
including personal credit scoring, risk management and customer
acquisition.
