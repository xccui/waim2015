		<h2>Call For Workshops</h2>

		<div class="main_body">
			<p>
			WAIM is a leading international conference for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to share and exchange ideas, results, experiences, techniques, and tools in connection with all aspects of Web data management. As the 16th event in the increasingly popular series, WAIM2015 expects to attract participants from all over the world to Qingdao, China, and continues to establish WAIM as one of the major conferences on Web-based information systems.
			</p>
			<p>
			We solicit proposals for half-day or full-day workshops in conjunction with WAIM 2015. Workshops are expected to focus on novel ideas on current and emerging topics relevant to the conference. All papers accepted by WAIM 2015 workshops will be published in a combined volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science series published by Springer.
			</p>
			<p>
			All workshops will benefit from the registration process of WAIM 2015 (we will have a single registration for conferences, workshops and tutorials). The workshop organizer(s) will be responsible for advertising the workshop, reviewing and selecting the papers.
			</p>
