<h2>Call For Demos</h2>

<div class="main_body">
<p>We are soliciting submissions for demos for WAIM 2015 in Qingdao, China. Submissions must describe working systems and be related to web-age information management. These systems may be innovative prototype implementations or mature systems that use related technology.
</p>
<p>
Demo submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria: relevance to the conference scope, technical novelty and practical impact of the demo systems, and potential interest to WAIM attendees. A successful demo paper will provide satisfactory answers to the following questions: What makes the presented piece of software unique and special? What are the innovative aspects or in what way/area does it represent the state of the art? For whom is it most interesting/useful - for a researcher, for a graduate or undergraduate student in these areas, for a practitioner? If there are similar/related pieces of software, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the one being presented?
</p>
<p>
The demo paper should provide adequate information on the system's architecture, individual components, the way the system is operated, and the way the system will be demonstrated during the conference. Figures, screenshots and interactive demo plans may be included if necessary. If applicable, the authors are also encouraged to provide a URL that points to a preview of the demo.
</p>
<p>
All accepted demo papers will be published in a joint volume with workshop papers by Springer in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Each camera-ready demo paper will be 3 pages long, including text, tables, figures, references, and all other materials. At least one of the demo submitters must register for the conference, and present during the conference a system demonstration including a poster. Based on the overall performance, one demo will be selected and offered the BEST DEMO AWARD of WAIM 2015.
</p>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>
The submission and notification process will be handled together with the regular papers of the conference, using an online system.
